**Niigata (新潟)** is often overlooked by travelers rushing to Kyoto or Hokkaido, but it is the undisputed capital of rice and sake in Japan. Facing the Sea of Japan, it offers incredible seafood, a relaxed city vibe, and easy access to snow country.

Here is my practical guide to navigating Niigata City.

## 🚄 How to Arrive
Niigata is surprisingly accessible from Tokyo, making it a perfect weekend getaway or a stopover towards the northern regions.

* **From Tokyo:** Take the **Joetsu Shinkansen (上越新幹線)** from Tokyo Station to Niigata Station.
    * **Time:** ~2 hours.
    * **Cost:** Covered by JR Pass (Nationwide) and JR East Nagano/Niigata Area Pass.
* **From Osaka/Kyoto:** Flight is recommended (to Niigata Airport, KIJ), or Shinkansen transferring at Tokyo.

## 🏨 Where to Stay
Niigata City is divided into two main areas by the Shinano River: **Bandai (New City)** and **Furumachi (Old Town)**.

1.  **Niigata Station Area (Recommended):**
    * *Best for:* Convenience, early trains, and access to the "Ponshukan" sake museum.
    * *Vibe:* Modern, busy, plenty of business hotels (Dormy Inn, APA, Mets).
2.  **Bandai City (10-15 min walk from station):**
    * *Best for:* Shopping (Bandai City Bus Center) and younger crowds.
    * *Vibe:* Commercial hub, close to the Rainbow Tower symbol.

## 👀 What to See & Do

### 1. Ponshukan (The Sake Museum)
Located *inside* Niigata Station (and another at Echigo-Yuzawa), this is a sake theme park.
* **The Highlight:** The Sake Vending Wall. Pay 500 yen for 5 tokens and a cup, then choose from over 100 local sakes to taste.
* **Don't miss:** The "Giant Onigiri" shop next door (Bakudan Onigiri).

### 2. Pia Bandai
A lively market area near the port.
* Great for fresh sushi (Benkei Sushi is famous here) and buying local souvenirs.
* You can grill seafood bought at the market at the BBQ area.

### 3. Befco Bakauke Observation Deck
* Located in the Hotel Nikko Niigata building.
* **Free admission** for a panoramic view of the city, the Shinano River, and the Sea of Japan.

### 4. Hakusan Shrine & Park
* A peaceful shrine dedicated to marriage and family harmony.
* Lovely walking paths, especially during cherry blossom season or autumn.

## 🍣 What to Eat
Niigata is famous for the "Three Whites": Snow, Rice, and Sake.

* **Koshihikari Rice:** Considered the best rice in Japan. Even simple salt onigiri tastes amazing here.
* **Tare Katsudon:** Unlike the egg-bound katsudon found elsewhere, Niigata's version is dipped in a soy-based sauce.
* **Hegi Soba:** Noodles made with seaweed (funori) binding, served in a wooden tray.
* **Sushi:** Thanks to the cold currents of the Sea of Japan, the fish is exceptionally fatty and fresh (try *Nodoguro* / Blackthroat Seaperch).
